<h2>Adding Machine Learning to your web or app quickly</h2>
<h3>For Web and App Developers...</h3>
<p>
PredictionIO comes with a few built-in predictive engines that you can use
out-of-the-box. No Machine Learning knowledge required. You may also customize
them to fit your specific application needs.
</p>
<h3>Learn how to use Built-in Engines</h3>
These few steps can get you familiar with PredictionIO's Built-in Engines
quickily.
<ul>
  <li>
    Read <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/tutorials/engines/quickstart.html">Using Built-in Engines:
    Quick Start</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Learn from some examples in <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/tutorials/engines">Tutorials
    &amp; Samples</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Deploying your own algorithms on production</h2>
<h3>For Data Scientists and Algorithm Developers...</h3>
<p>
If built-in engines don't fit your need, you can also create a new engine and
deploy your own algorithm easily. PredictionIO server handles the heavy-lifting
for production deployment, so that you can focus on your unique prediction
challenges.
