Setting up [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) to work with PredictionIO.

Make sure you have PostgreSQL installed. For Mac Users, [Homebrew](brew.sh) is recommended and can be used as

```
$ brew install postgresql
```
or on Ubuntu:
```
apt-get install postgresql-9.4 
```

Now that PostgreSQL is installed use the following comands

```
$ createdb pio
``` 

If you get an error of the form `could not connect to server: No such file or directory`, then you must first start the server manually,:

```
$ pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres -l /usr/local/var/postgres/server.log start
```

You also need to download JDBC driver from [JDBC-postgresql](https://jdbc.postgresql.org/download.html).
Put file in `PredictionIO-0.9.6/lib`, and rename path at PredictionIO-0.9.6/conf/pio-env.sh if name of driver file is diffrent with default one.

```
POSTGRES_JDBC_DRIVER=$PIO_HOME/lib/postgresql-9.4.1210.jre7.jar
```

Finally use the command:

```
$ psql -c "create user pio with password 'pio'"
```

Your configuration  in `pio-env.sh` is now compatible to run with PostgreSQL.
