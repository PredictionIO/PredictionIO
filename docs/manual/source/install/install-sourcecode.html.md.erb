---

INFO: Assuming you are following the directory structure in the followoing,
replace `/home/abc` with your own home directory wherever you see it.

## Building

Run the following to download and build Apache PredictionIO (incubating) from
its source code.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/apache/incubator-predictionio.git
$ cd incubator-predictionio
$ git checkout master

PredictionIO-<%= data.versions.pio %>/conf/
PredictionIO-<%= data.versions.pio %>/conf/pio-env.sh
PredictionIO binary distribution created at PredictionIO-<%= data.versions.pio %>.tar.gz
```

Extract the binary distribution you have just built.

```
$ tar zxvf PredictionIO-<%= data.versions.pio %>.tar.gz
```


## Installing Dependencies

Let us install dependencies inside a subdirectory of the Apache PredictionIO
(incubating) installation. By following this convention, you can use

```
$ mkdir PredictionIO-<%= data.versions.pio %>/vendors
```
