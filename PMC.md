## Release Procedure

1. Generate code signing key if you do not already have one for Apache. Refer to
http://apache.org/dev/openpgp.html#generate-key on how to generate a strong code
signing key.
2. Add your public key to the `KEYS` file at the root of the source code tree.
3. Create a new release branch, with version bumped to the next release version.
    * `git checkout -b release/0.13.0`
    * Replace all `0.13.0-SNAPSHOT` in the code tree to `0.13.0`.
    * `git commit -am "Prepare 0.13.0-rc1"`
    * `git tag -am "Apache PredictionIO 0.13.0-rc1" v0.13.0-rc1`
4. If you have not done so, use SVN to checkout
https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/predictionio. This is the area
for staging release candidates for voting.
    * `svn co https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/predictionio`
5.  Package a clean tarball for staging a release candidate.
    * `git archive --format tar v0.13.0-rc1 >
  ../apache-predictionio-0.13.0-rc1.tar`
    * `cd ..; gzip apache-predictionio-0.13.0-rc1.tar`
6. Generate detached signature for the release candidate.
(http://apache.org/dev/release-signing.html#openpgp-ascii-detach-sig)
    * `gpg --armor --output apache-predictionio-0.13.0-rc1.tar.gz.asc
  --detach-sig apache-predictionio-0.13.0-rc1.tar.gz`
7. Generate MD5 and SHA512 checksums for the release candidate.
    * `gpg --print-md MD5 apache-predictionio-0.13.0-rc1.tar.gz >
  apache-predictionio-0.13.0-rc1.tar.gz.md5`
    * `gpg --print-md SHA512 apache-predictionio-0.13.0-rc1.tar.gz >
  apache-predictionio-0.13.0-rc1.tar.gz.sha512`
8. Run `./make-distribution.sh` and repeat steps 5 to 7 to create binary distribution release.
9. Create a subdirectory at the SVN staging area. The area should have a `KEYS` file.
    * `mkdir apache-predictionio-0.13.0-rc1`
    * `cp apache-predictionio-0.13.0-rc1.*
  apache-predictionio-0.13.0-rc1`
10. If you have updated the `KEYS` file, also copy that to the staging area.
11. `svn commit`
12. Set up credentials with Apache Nexus using the SBT Sonatype plugin. Put this
in `~/.sbt/0.13/sonatype.sbt`. You can generate username and password tokens
from ASF's Nexus instance.

  ```
  publishTo := {
      val nexus = "https://repository.apache.org/"
      if (isSnapshot.value)
        Some("snapshots" at nexus + "content/repositories/snapshots")
      else
        Some("releases" at nexus + "service/local/staging/deploy/maven2")
  }

  credentials += Credentials("Sonatype Nexus Repository Manager", "repository.apache.org", "username_token", "password_token")
  ```
13. `sbt/sbt +publishSigned +storage/publishSigned
+dataElasticsearch/publishSigned` then close the staged repository on Apache
Nexus.
    * You may need to run `sbt/sbt publishLocal` first to avoid depedency errors.
14. Wait for Travis to pass build on the release branch.
15. Tag the release branch with a rc tag, e.g. `0.13.0-rc1`.
16. Send out email for voting on PredictionIO dev mailing list.

  ```
